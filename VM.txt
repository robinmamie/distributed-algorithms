We provide two variants of the Virtual Machine (VM) Image:

The first variant comes with all the necessary build tools and also includes GuestAdditions. GuestAdditions allows for easy transfer (drag and drop) of files between the VM and the HOST, as well as copying from clipboard between the VM and HOST. You can enable these features from Menu->Devices->Shared Clipboard and Menu->Devices->Drag and Drop.

The second variant comes with all the necessary build tools, but does not include GuestAdditions. Use this variant only if you are experiecing compatibility problems with the first variant:
